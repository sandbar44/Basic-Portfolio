            <p>Hi there! I'm Sandra, a lifetime consultant now dabbling in software development. This site demonstrates
                my software development skills. Please take a look around!</p>
            <p>I am a strategic product owner with strong experience in revenue strategy, supply chain management, and
                operations improvement. My diverse project experience includes IT application implementation, revenue
                management, inventory optimization, demand forecasting, production planning, and data analysis across
                various industries including B2B, retail, hospitality, transportation, and manufacturing. I am a quick
                learner, adaptable, and flexible with proficiency in cross-functional project management, solution
                design, and analytical tools.</p>
            <p>I'm a proud Emory alum, which also means I have very little interest in college football. I'd rather play
                sports than watch them. My competitive spirit motiavtes me to achieve excellence. I don't have the most
                creative ideas, but I can take yours and make it even better! Eat your fruit, juice your veggies, and be
                active!</p>
